        This method finds a loop cut in the dfg.
        Implementation follows function LoopCut on page 190 of
        "Robust Process Mining with Guarantees" by Sander J.J. Leemans (ISBN: 978-90-386-4257-4)

        Basic Steps:
        1. merge all start and end activities in one group ('do' group)
        2. remove start/end activities from the dfg
        3. detect connected components in (undirected representative) of the reduced graph
        4. check if each component meets the start/end criteria of the loop cut definition (merge with the 'do' group if not)
        5. return the cut if at least two groups remain
